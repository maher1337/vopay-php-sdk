# Vopay PHP SDK
This is an SDK for PHP to interface own platform with VoPay payment gateway. Uses [VoPay API v2](https://docs.vopay.com/v2/vopay-api-reference/ref).

## Features

* Follows PSR-0 conventions and coding standards: autoload friendly
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested
* Usable with Symfony, Laravel and other Web Application Frameworks

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.4 with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension,
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) >= 7.0.1 library,
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) to run tests.

## Installation
It is easiest to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install, simply run:

    composer require matteocacciola/vopay-sdk

Or add to the ```require``` section of your ```composer.json``` file:

    "matteocacciola/vopay-sdk"

## Basic usage

```php
use maher1337\VoPay\VoPay;

$client = new VoPay('account_id', 'api-key', 'api_secret');
```

The `$client` object gives you access to the entire VoPay API. E.g.: if you want to access the set of endpoints related to [VoPay Account](https://docs.vopay.com/v2/vopay-api-reference/ref#tag-account-endpoints), you just need to code:

```php
$account = $client->account();
```

Similarly, for example, with [VoPay EFT Endpoints](https://docs.vopay.com/v2/vopay-api-reference/ref#tag-electronic-funds-transfer-endpoints):

```php
$account = $client->electronicFundsTransfer();
```

and so forth.

## API Coverage
Currently, all the APIs are supported by this SDK.

## Tests
The package is provided with mocks for each subset of endpoints: you can easily mimic the successful or failing response by just passing a simple parameter to the mock.

Here is an example.

In a service, for instance, you could have the following method:
```php
/**
 * @param string $endpoint
 *
 * @return VoPayContract
 * @throws \Exception
 */
protected function buildVopayEndpointGroup(string $endpoint) : VoPayContract
{
    return $this->apiVopay->{$endpoint}();
}
```

returning the subset of endpoints, like `account` or `electronicFundsTransfer` etc. Loosely speaking, the `$endpoint` is one of the name of the methods provided by `maher1337\VoPay\VoPay` client.

Then, here is what you could mock in a test:

```php
use Mockery\MockInterface;
use maher1337\VoPay\Endpoints\Mocks\ElectronicFundsTransfer;

// $shouldTestSucceed is a boolean: true if the mocked response from the VoPay API should succeed, false otherwise
$this->partialMock(SomeClass::class, function (MockInterface $mock) use ($shouldTestSucceed) {
    $mock->shouldReceive('buildVopayEndpointGroup')
        ->with('electronicFundsTransfer')
        ->andReturn(new ElectronicFundsTransfer($shouldTestSucceed));
});
```
